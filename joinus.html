                    Club membership is available to both experienced and novice paddlers with the main club session taking place on a Sunday all year round. There are several different coaching groups and new members are placed into the groups depending on their age and/or ability. Equipment and coaching is provided.

				</p>
				<p>
					Starter sessions generally run on a Sunday (unless specified) and your first session is a free taster session. Those who have attended a starter session and would like to continue will be invited to come to a series of beginner sessions on Sunday mornings. Demand can be high though, so please bear with us. During the summer months, we tend to have a waiting list to help meet the demand.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have recently increased our ages to join the canoe club and this is because of the number of boats we have for younger children. The starting age at our canoe club is 10 years old, however if it is not a busy period and the child is a good swimmer and tall for their age then an exception can be made.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those with previous paddling experience who either are returning to the sport, moving from another canoe club or transferring from a similar part of the sport; we can arrange a short session which will allow us to decide which coaching group you should join. <br>
					During the week, there are many other sessions that are run by the more advanced coaches on an invite only basis.
				</p>
				<h3>Guest Fees and Membership Subscriptions</h3>
				<p>
					To give you the chance to try out the club and see if it's for you, you can paddle as a guest at no cost on your first session, before deciding whether to join the club as a member. Any other sessions as a guest cost £10 per session.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Full membership</b> of the club is by annual subscription £168 (senior) / £120 (junior, i.e. under 18). There are discounts if two or more family members join as Full Members. The subscription year runs from December to November and annual subscriptions are calculated pro rata for those joining mid-year. For new members, a three-month <b>Associate Membership</b> is also available - £70 (senior) / £50 (junior).
				</p>
				<p>
					As a new club member you will initially be able to attend Sunday sessions, and as you improve you will also be able to attend more advanced training at other times by arrangement with the volunteer coaches.
