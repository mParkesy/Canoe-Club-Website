					Whitlingham Lane, Norwich.
				</p>
				<p>
					The clubhouse can be reached on foot/bike by following either the track running from the old Rowing Canoe Club building by the side of the road or by walking along the paths from the Whitlingham car parks which are further down the road. The area not only has the River Wensum but also the Whitlingham lake as well as a smaller lake which is now fenced off.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>To drive to the club</strong>, leave Norwich city via the train station and head past the football ground. Turn left at the next junction and follow this to a roundabout. Leave the roundabout on the exit where there is a railway bridge and the fire service. Heading over the bridge you will pass several houses and a driveway for a building company. Continue past this and turn left onto Whitlingham Lane. Head along the road for around a mile. Along the way you will pass several car parks which can be used for a small fee. You will need to know your cars registration to pay the parking fee.<br>
					To reach the club house you will need to head down one of the paths that goes towards the main lake. Follow this path to the sheltered building at the end of the lake. Head down the track behind this building and you will reach our club house.

				<p>
					If at any point you are given access to the track to drop off or pick up a boat then you can do so by driving through the old rowing club. Please keep to the speed limit of 5mph.
				</p>
				<h3>Public Transport</h3>
				<p>
					Public transport is fairly difficult with our canoe club.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Train and bus</strong>: The nearest main bus stop is the railway station. From here we estimate the walk being 20 minutes. Trains are an option for those out of Norwich city, with rail links to Wymonham, Spooner Row, Brundall, Lingwood, Salhouse, Acle, Hoveton & Wroxham, Buckenham and Cantley.<br>
					<strong>Taxi</strong>: There is a taxi rank outside the railway station and there are local services including <a href="http://courtesytaxis.com/">Courtesy Taxis (01603 446644)</a> and <a href="http://www.abctaxisnorwich.co.uk/">ABC Taxis (01603 666333)</a>.
