						After 2 months of renovations and help from the local council with a small grant, we are finally able to announce that the canoe club gym will be opening on Saturday the 7th of November. You will be able to try out the gym from 11am onwards. For those that unaware, it can be found to left hand side of the club house from the car park down a small set of stairs. It can also be accessed river side for disabled visitors.

						Please support one of our paddlers who is raising money which will go towards her trip to Uganda next year. Each cake will be Â£1 each. The cake sale will begin at 11.30am which is when the usual training sessions finish.<br>
						The trip to Uganda will be a life time experience for Bethany and she will be helping a small local community linked to her secondary school by helping build a new building for recycled IT equipment.

						The punts were out in force for the Cambridge Winter Series race, thanks to the lovely autumn sunshine. The standard of racing was extremely high, especially on the 7-mile course, with many of the region's top paddlers participating.<br>
						The team of 27 from Canary Canoes took second place for the club, narrowly beating Barking by just three points. Many thanks to everyone who paddled - every point made a difference.

						After several months, the club is now officially recognised on the Club Mark scheme.
						Well done to all the volunteers who have put countless hours into sorting out accounts, membership, the club house and the coaching system so that we become recognised as a structured sports club.
