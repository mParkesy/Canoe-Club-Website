# Canary Canoes, Canoe Club Website

A basic static HTML website created during the Foundation Year of my university degree.
The task was aimed at learning the basics of HTML and CSS whilst also undertaking some research into the correct
materials to have on the site.

## Getting Started and Installation

As the website is static HTML, it can either be viewed here or the ZIP can be downloaded.
If the ZIP is downloaded then please open the index with your preffered web browser.
