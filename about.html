					Canary Canoes was founded in 1985 and has a developing membership of all ages and abilities. There is now an equal balance adults and juniors. The club is funded principally by membership subscriptions and grass-roots fundraising. It is run entirely by the voluntary effort of its member, and there are many opportunities for non-paddling parents of junior members to become involved.<br>
					The club has a clubhouse which is situated on the outskirts of Norwich City alongside the River Wensum. The club has changing rooms, toilets and hot showers. There are also kitchen facilities available with drinks such as coffee, tea and squash. The club also has a social area with sofas kindly donated by the clubs members and there are collapsible tables which can be put up if needed.<br>
					We also have a boat store next to the club house which has a capacity of 100 boats which includes both club boats and private boats. This was built in 2008 with the help from several grants including Sport England, Canoe England and the Norfolk Council. We have continued to work closely with these partners so that we can continue to invest in the clubs facilities.

					The Canoe Club has always focused on flat water canoeing and kayaking, however occasssionally there are trips to the Lee Valley White Water Centre or to more natural moving waters. We tend to allow people to go out for relaxing paddles in small groups once they are competent enough. There are however the racing groups who focus on sprint and marathon racing which they carry out across the country in both canoes and kayaks. The canoe club is part of the Easter Region and takes part in a series of races called the Hasler Series and it is also recognised as a racing club that can attend National events such as The National Watersport Centre in Nottingham.
